# I learned how to make one instapot recipe during COVID...

Entire recipe taken from this source: https://www.tasteslovely.com/paleo-whole30-instant-pot-bbq-ribs/

# INGREDIENTS
- 1 rack pork ribs
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 teaspoons pepper
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 cup water
-  BBQ sauce

# INSTRUCTIONS
- If the ribs have the membrane skin on the back, remove it.
- Combine the salt, pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder and onion powder in a small bowl, stir to combine.
- Top both sides of the ribs with the dry rub, and rub in.
- Place the trivet inside your Instant Pot. Pour in 1 cup of water.
- Stand the ribs upright inside, so the bones are vertical. My ButcherBox ribs come pre-cut in half. If you have a full rack, you can curve it around to fit inside or cut them smaller. Close with the lid. Make sure the vent is in the sealed position.
- Cook on manual pressure for 25 minutes. Naturally release pressure for 15 minutes, then do a quick release.
- After the 25 minutes, preheat your oven on broil. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.
- Place the ribs on the baking sheet. Brush with BBQ sauce.
- Broil the ribs in your oven for 5-8 minutes, until charred and crispy. Keep a close eye on them. My oven takes exactly 7 minutes. (You can also do this on your BBQ, but I prefer the oven)
- Remove from the oven, and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Slice the ribs and serve.
- Leftovers will keep in an airtight container for 5 days.
