# Breakfast Tacos
#### Spicy and yummy.
## Ingredients:
- Pork chorizo
- Eggs
- Queso ranchero or queso fresco
- Sour cream
- Avocado
- Cilantro
- Tortillas
##### Note that I didn’t put amounts here. It’s basically one egg and 2 ounces of chorizo per two tacos, so figure out how many you’re going to make then you can figure out amounts.
## Directions:
1. Crack eggs into a bowl. Add a little milk (I know I didn’t put it above; it’s optional)
2. Warm tortillas however you like to do it (ideal: in a large frying pan with a tiny bit of oil)
3. Put a pan on medium heat. When warm, add the chorizo. It spatters, so wear an apron!
4. Cook for around 2-3 minutes, until chorizo darkens in color. Add the egg mixture and stir
constantly. The eggs will scramble. When firm, they’re done!
5. Assemble the tacos: Put some sour cream down on the tortilla. Add a spoonful of the
egg/chorizo mixture. Top with cheese, avocado, and cilantro.
