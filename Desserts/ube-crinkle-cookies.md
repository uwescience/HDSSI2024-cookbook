**Ube Crinkle Cookies**

**Cookie dough**
1¾ cups (210 g) all-purpose flour
½ cup (100 g) granulated sugar
1 tsp baking powder
½ cup (120 g) unsalted butter, melted
1 large egg
½ cup (113 g) ube halaya (ube jam)
1 tsp ube extract

**Assembly**
Caster (superfine) sugar, for rolling
Icing (powdered) sugar, for rolling

Chilling time: 30 minutes. Freezing time: 1 hour.
Cooling time (after baking): 30 minutes.

**Instructions**
- To make the cookies, combine the flour, sugar, and baking powder in a mixing bowl, and whisk until combined. Mix in the melted butter, egg, ube halaya, and ube extract. Cover the bowl with cling wrap and chill for 30 minutes, or until firm.
- Once chilled, roll the dough into ten balls and freeze for 1 hour, or until solid.
- To bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Line a baking tray with baking paper.
- Remove the cookie dough from the freezer and roll each ball in superfine sugar, then powdered sugar, ensuring the dough is well coated. Place the coated balls on the prepared tray, leaving 5 cm (2 inches) in between to prevent them from spreading into each other, and bake for 15 minutes or until set. Remove from the oven and cool for 30 minutes, or until completely cool.
- Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days.
