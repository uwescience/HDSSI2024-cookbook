RC's LEMON TART

1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup unbleached flour
1/4 cup powdered sugar
1/4 teaspoon lemon juice (or extract)
pinch of salt

Preheat oven to 350◦.  Butter 9inch pie pan.  With an electric mixer, cream all the ingredients until soft and smooth.  Press dough evenly into the pan and sort of up the sides, maybe a finger, and then bake for 20 minutes.  Meanwhile make the topping.

2 eggs
1 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon lemon juice (or extract)
juice and zest of one lemon (highly recommend a Meyer lemon if it is available)
1/4 cup unbleached flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
powdered sugar (for sprinkling afterwards)

With electric mixer, beat eggs well and gradually add sugar until the mixture is thick.  Then slowly add the remaining ingredients, except powdered sugar.  Continue beating until crust comes out of the oven.  Pour lemon mixture over the hot crust, return to the oven and reduce heat to 325◦.  Bake 30-35 minutes until the top is golden.  Cool and dust with powdered sugar when served.
